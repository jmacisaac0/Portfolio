This is a collection of projects written by Julia. They are listed below, along with a short summary and where they were completed.

## C# Projects

These projects can be run in Visual Studio and possibly Visual Studio Code.

### Athlete Program

The Athlete Program was a project that was required to complete multiple times across the curriculum of York Tech. It is a simple program in which the user is asked to input the name and salary of an athlete, then is allowed to hire one of four "professionals", each with their own salary as a percentage of the athletes'. For example, lawyers make one-tenth of the athlete's salary. Once the user has hired everyone they wish to, the program will return information such as how much money the athlete has left, if they have gone over budget, etc. This was the final time I wrote this program, which includes a database to store professional objects and a GUI, whereas before the user interacted with the program via the console.

### Single Linked List

Implementation of a singly linked list written in my Data Structures class at York Tech. Included is also an ordered list using the original linked list. The singly linked list class defines a node class, which can point to the next node. These are used to hold the elements of the list. It also includes methods to add and remove elements from the list, as well as an overloaded .toString() method used to print the list. A driver program is included to test the linked list.

### Double Linked List 

Written in the same class as my single linked list and includes the same elements. This list allows traversal both backwards and forwards by adding a second variable in each node object used to point the previous element in the list. The same mathods are present and updated.
